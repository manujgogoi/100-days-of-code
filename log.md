# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn CSS flexbox, read articles on Javascript Module.

**Thoughts:** I am very bad at design and Layout Websites. I want to clear my concepts on CSS positioning, flexbox, grids etc for designing complex layouts easily. I also want to master MERN Stack.

### Day 2: August 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned some basics of TypeScript, such as:
1. Install TypeScript using npm
2. Compile TypeScript file using tsc
3. Read articles on Type Inference, Interface and implementing an Interface.
I also started a project to build an E-commerce product page using mainly CSS flexbox. (partially completed).

**Thoughts:** While building the webpage, I was confused with some CSS Flexbox properties and it made my mind completely blank. I need to practice more to clear flexbox concept.

### Day 3: August 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I have learned JavaScript array data structure and its built-in methods. 
I have completed my project on E-Commerce Product Page. I have used JavaScript fetch API to get some demo products from Fake Store API.
It is not looking great but by doing this, I have learned lot of things related to CSS.

**Thoughts:** Today I'm happy to complete this Web project. I'm thinking to extend and improve this Web project to a fully functional e-commerce website in near future.
